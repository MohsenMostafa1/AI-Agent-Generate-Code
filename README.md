This Agent can generate any code for developers  

. Executive Summary

The Advanced Feedback-Driven Code Generation System is a high-performance, intelligent API built to understand natural language instructions and generate high-quality, context-aware code. It transcends basic code completion by integrating a continuous learning loop, a suite of executable tools, and an auto-optimizing architecture. The system is built on a modern Python stack using FastAPI, leverages the deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct large language model (LLM), and is designed for both interactive use in environments like Google Colab and deployment as a robust production service.
2. Core Architecture & Philosophy

The system is built on a multi-agent, feedback-driven philosophy. It doesn't just generate code; it learns from every interaction.

3. Detailed Technical Components
3.1. The Orchestrator: FeedbackDrivenCodeAgent

This is the brain of the operation. It coordinates all other components.

    Streaming Generation: Generates code token-by-token for real-time responsiveness.

    Context Building: Dynamically constructs a prompt from the user's task, relevant knowledge snippets, best historical examples, and project files.

    Function Call Interception: Parses the model's output stream to detect and execute requested tools (e.g., <function>execute_code</function>{...}).

    Error Resilience: Implements comprehensive try-catch blocks to ensure a single point of failure doesn't crash the entire generation process.

3.2. The Memory & Knowledge System

a) FeedbackAwareRetriever (Short-term, Vector-Based Memory):

    Technology: Uses hnswlib (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for extremely fast approximate nearest neighbor search.

    Embeddings: Transforms code snippets into 384-dimensional vectors using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer.

    Smart Ranking: Doesn't just retrieve semantically similar code. It ranks results based on a combined score:
    Combined Score = (Feedback_Weight * Feedback_Score) + (Usage_Weight * Normalized_Usage_Count)

    Auto-Optimization: Periodically runs an ArchitectureOptimizer (using the optuna framework) to tune HNSW parameters (M, ef_construction) for optimal search performance and accuracy.

b) CodeMemory (Long-term, Persistent Memory):

    Technology: SQLite database with multiple structured tables.

    Data Stored:

        code_history: Every generated code snippet, linked to its query, feedback scores, and execution results.

        knowledge_base: Curated, high-quality code examples and patterns.

        project_context: User-uploaded project files for deep context awareness.

        feedback_log: Detailed records of all user feedback.

        function_calls: Audit log of all tool executions.

    Context Awareness: Can retrieve a "context window" of previous generations related to the current task.

3.3. The Function Calling System (FunctionCallingSystem)

This subsystem allows the LLM to break out of pure generation and take actions.

    Pattern: The LLM outputs a structured XML-like tag (<function>tool_name</function>) followed by a JSON payload of parameters.

    Available Tools:

        execute_code: Runs code in a sandboxed Docker container.

        lint_code: Checks code for syntax errors and style issues using language-specific linters (flake8, eslint).

        get_knowledge / search_code: Retrieves relevant snippets from the knowledge base or vector store.

        get_history: Fetches the best-rated historical generations.

    Autonomous Operation: The agent can call a tool, receive the result, and continue generation based on that result, enabling complex, multi-step reasoning.

3.4. The Execution Engine (CodeExecutor)

    Safety First: Executes all user-submitted code in isolated Docker containers with strict resource limits (CPU, memory, no network access).

    Multi-Language Support: Pre-configured Docker images for Python, Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), and Java.

    Linting Integration: Provides pre-execution code quality checks.

3.5. The Model Layer

    Core Model: deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct, a state-of-the-art 6.7 billion parameter model fine-tuned for code instruction following.

    Optimized Loading: The load_model_with_gpu() function implements a fallback strategy: first trying automatic GPU allocation, then manual GPU loading, and finally falling back to CPU, ensuring maximum compatibility.

    Generation Configuration: Controlled parameters for creativity (temperature=0.7), focus (top_p=0.9), and repetition avoidance (repetition_penalty=1.1).

7. API Overview

The system exposes a RESTful API via FastAPI with automatic Swagger documentation at /docs.

Key Endpoints:

    POST /generate_code: Main endpoint for streaming code generation.

    POST /execute_code: Executes a code snippet and optionally provides feedback.

    POST /feedback: Submits a rating for a previous generation.

    GET /knowledge/get/{language}: Retrieves knowledge items.

    GET /history/best/{language}: Gets the highest-rated historical code.

    POST /optimize/retriever: Manually triggers the retriever optimization.

7. Deployment & Execution

In Google Colab:

    The run_in_colab() function handles everything.

    It spins up the FastAPI server in a background thread.

    It uses pyngrok to create a secure public tunnel to the Colab instance.

    Provides example curl commands to test the API immediately.

As a Production Service:

    Set USE_DOCKER = True.

    Ensure Docker is installed and running on the host machine.

    Run the script directly (python apl.py). Uses uvicorn to serve the app with configurable workers and resource limits.

8. Conclusion

This system represents a significant advancement over standard code generation tools. It is not a static model but a dynamic, learning platform. By seamlessly integrating generation, execution, verification, and memory, it creates a robust feedback loop that continuously improves the quality and relevance of its output. Its modular design, comprehensive API, and built-in optimization make it suitable for both research experimentation and powering next-generation developer assistance tools.
